# Chapter 1. Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications

Data-intensive applications focus on handling large volumes of data, complex data structures, and rapidly changing data. Here are the essential components used in these applications:

### 1. Databases
- **What They Do**: Store data for later retrieval by the same or another application.

### 2. Caches
- **What They Do**: Save the results of costly operations to make future data retrieval faster.

### 3. Search Indexes
- **What They Do**: Enable keyword searches and data filtering to help users find information quickly.

### 4. Stream Processing
- **What They Do**: Send data to other processes asynchronously, allowing for non-blocking operations.

### 5. Batch Processing
- **What They Do**: Regularly process large data sets to update systems, generate reports, or support other operations.
