# Chapter 1. Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications

Data-intensive applications (as opposed to compute-intensive) focus on handling large volumes of data, complex data structures, and rapidly changing data. Here are the essential components used in these applications:

### 1. Databases
- **What They Do**: Store data for later retrieval by the same or another application.

### 2. Caches
- **What They Do**: Save the results of costly operations to make future data retrieval faster.

### 3. Search Indexes
- **What They Do**: Enable keyword searches and data filtering to help users find information quickly.

### 4. Stream Processing
- **What They Do**: Send data to other processes asynchronously, allowing for non-blocking operations.

### 5. Batch Processing
- **What They Do**: Regularly process large data sets to update systems, generate reports, or support other operations.


## Core Qualities of Data-Intensive Applications

### Reliability
- **Definition**: The system should continue to operate correctly, performing its required functions under both normal and adverse conditions.
- **Challenges**: Includes handling hardware failures, software errors, and human mistakes.

### Scalability
- **Definition**: The system should handle growth — whether in data volume, traffic, or complexity — effectively and efficiently.
- **Strategies**: Implement scalable solutions to manage increased load.

### Maintainability
- **Definition**: Different people (engineers and operators) should be able to work on the system productively, both to maintain its current state and to adapt it to new requirements.
- **Key Aspect**: The system should be designed to facilitate updates and maintenance.
